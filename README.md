#SpringMVC/SpringData/JPA/JTA Practice

##Submission
A) The source code: I prefer if you upload your project to Github and send me the link.


##Goals: 

To create a website similar to www.imdb.com; where the users will be able to:

1) See information about movies and their artists

2) Search the database by different criterias like:

Name of the movie

Genre of the movie

Rating of the movie

Year of the movie

Name of the artist

Director of the movie

For the movies, it has to have at least the poster of the movie, a brief summary, the title and year. Also lists of directors, actors, genres. and a rating field. 

Users will be able to add comments about the movies

Artists will have information about their name, date of birth (optional), place of birth, a biography, at least one picture, and the
list of movies they have worked on.

You don't have to create a nice/sophisticated web site, just the simplest to demonstrate your abilities use SpingMVC, SpringData, JPA, JTA.  

Add the instructions on how to execute CRUD operations and how to execute the queries that were specified on point 2.
